# AIRLIFT: A Polygon OpenSea Airdrop Manager

## Summary

**AIRLIFT is a simple specification for a utility to manage bulk Polygon NFT transfers (airdrops) using the OpenSea API.**

## Problem Statement

OpenSea's support for the Polygon blockchain is enabling content creators to mint and transfer Polygon-based NFTs at little or no cost. However, for managing airdrops and other bulk NFT transfers, OpenSea's existing manual tooling is tedious and error-prone. 

AIRLIFT seeks to use OpenSea's API to create a better user experience for NFT airdrop managers working with Polygon on OpenSea.

## User Stories

- Connect a wallet to AIRLIFT that I also connected to OpenSea, so that I can be authenticated.
